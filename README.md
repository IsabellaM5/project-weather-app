# Weather App ☁️ 

In this project, Isabella and Yennie worked together to build a weather app. 

This project was to learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in an app.


## The problem

The main task was to build a weather app. We chose to fetch and display weather data for Kuala Lumpur. In general, it was a fun project and easy to understand what we were supposed to do and how the API worked. 

Basically we fetched data from two API urls which we then displayed on the website in a converted format. Some data was easy to fetch and we would immediately be able to use it. Other data regarding the weather forecast, we had to do a filtering and then map over the arrays/objects. We used an icon to display the current weather according to the id data that we used from the API. We focused to securing the correct data before moving on to styling the webpage. We also made the webpage responsive.

If we had more time we would add more cities and change the background image depending on the chosen city, changing the background color depending on if it's day or night and other stretch goals.
